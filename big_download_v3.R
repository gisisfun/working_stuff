# Read me first
# 
# MERIT is a  customer relationship  management system (CRM) that manages 
# services  (products) with target measures (KPIs) and/or outcomes (goals) 
# with evidence (supporting documents). Some target measures (KPIs) have more 
# than one unit cost. These data are collected, displayed and exported in a 
# range of data sets with each having their own data format (model). 
# The meaning of these data stored in the system is different for 
# each user and role type 

# The Analytical Data Set extracts and transforms these data into a new 
# singluar structure (model) that  can function within an API.
#
# Methodology
#
# - Services (products) and target measures (KPIs) are mapped to 'projects'
# - Products and KPIs create quarterly semester reporting events with the opportunity to invoice
#   against generic products and KPIs identified in standard MERI contract or derived for the
#   purpose of reporting. 
# - To date, unit cost category data is summed together in the output of to the unit cost level.
# - A new view of the data set would be required to report at the unit cost catageory level.
# 
# The different activity report column names are changed to make them the same.
# - 'category' data column - the dropdown category reported in the activity reporting shell
# - 'sub_category' data column - the text value used to 
# - 'measured' data column - the area (Ha) or length (km) mapped
# - 'actual' data column - the value representing the non mapped or the measure value 
# - 'invoiced' data column - the value used with the unit cost category and unit cost rate 
#   (held outside the MERIT system)
# - 'context' - the value holding a text reponse, can be a species, comments, or 
#   sub sub category.
# - 'report_species' data column - the value holding the contents of the report species column.
#   this mapped column can hold the unit cost category data - where mapped.
# - 
#
# The R code transforms data in MERIT (NoSQL) to line item (SQL) by project and 
# project report views. Everything looks the same but is different

# projects - reports - species view
# A grants view of procurement activity report data with grants activities 
# presented with procurement-like columns (measured,actual and invoiced). 
# Additional report species content related to each project are recorded.
# * Will require mapping of balance of report data items to provide complete
# coverage of available data.
#
# projects - species view
# A projects line item view with summarised project assets, investment priorities, 
# report species and MNES categories against investment priority. 
#
# Data Source: The Big Download of MERIT (Spreadsheets)
#
# The rest of the downloads from 2 onwards are a selection of programs and the 
# reports relevant to that program.  So to reproduce these, you would select 
# the same program/sub-programs, then tick all of the boxes below "Activity 
# summary" that appear.  From memory I had to exclude a couple of discontinued 
# forms from biodiversity fund and C4oC as they were causing download issues.
# The program categories I chose are:
#
# 1.	All tabs up to and including the "Activity summary" tab.  No filters 
# applied (so all projects)
